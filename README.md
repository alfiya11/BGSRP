Exploring the Foundations of Quantum Computing: An Introductory Study
During my internship, I had the
opportunity to explore the fundamental ideas and principles underlying this
quantum computing research.
I began by giving a brief overview of information theory, which is critical
for understanding how information is processed in quantum systems. This
motivated the discussion of qubits, the basic quantum units of information,
which can exist in multiple states at the same time due to superposition, in
contrast to the classical bits.
Understanding qubits required the introduction of some linear algebra,
which is the mathematical framework used to describe and manipulate quan-
tum states, after which I discussed quantum gates and circuits, which form
the basis of quantum algorithms. Hilbert space, a special mathematical space
where quantum states live, was another key topic. I learned about the inner
and outer product operations, which are important for quantum calculations
and measurements.
The postulates of quantum mechanics provided the rules that govern
how quantum systems behave. I also studied the density matrix, a tool
for describing mixed states, and the Bloch sphere, a visual way to represent
qubit states.
The Gottesman-Knill theorem showed that some quantum circuits can be
efficiently simulated by classical computers, which helps in understanding the
limits of quantum power. I also delved into entanglement, a unique property
where quantum particles become interconnected, playing a crucial role in
quantum communication and cryptography.
Finally, I learned about quantum error-correcting codes, focusing on
Shor’s 9-qubit code, which is vital for building reliable quantum comput-
ers that can correct errors caused by noise and other disturbances.
This report summarizes the essential topics I studied, providing a foun-
dational understanding of quantum computing’s principles and techniques.
This knowledge is a stepping stone for future advancements and innovations
in this transformative field.
